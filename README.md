# Correlation and regression for data analysis

## NAME: SUDARSAN.A
## REG.NO :212224220111
# Fitting Poisson  distribution
# Aim : 

To fit poisson distribution for the arrival of objects per minute from the feeder

# Software required :  

Python and Visual component tool

# Theory:

The Poisson distribution is the discrete probability distribution of the number of events occurring in a given time period, given the average number of times the event occurs over that time period.

 Conditions for Poisson Distribution:

1. An event can occur any number of times during a time period.
2. Events occur independently. I
3. The rate of occurrence is constant.
4. The probability of an event occurring is proportional to the length of the time period.

print("--------------------------")
for x in range(M+1):
    p.append(math.exp(-mean)*mean**x/math.factorial(x))
    E.append(p[x]*sf)
    xi.append((f[x]-E[x])**2/E[x])

print("Calculated value of Chi square is %4.2f"%cal_chi2_sq)
table_chi2=scipy.stats.chi2.ppf(1-.01,df=M)
print("Table value of chi square at 1 level is %4.2f"%table_chi2)
if cal_chi2_sq<table_chi2:
    print("The given data can be fitted in poisson Distribution at 1% LOS")
else:
    print("The given data cannot be fitted in Poisson Distribution at 1% LOS")

# Software required :  

Python

# Theory:

Correlation describes the strength of an association between two variables, and is completely symmetrical, the correlation between A and B is the same as the correlation between B and A. However, if the two variables are related it means that when one changes by a certain amount the other changes on an average by a certain amount.  

If y represents the dependent variable and x the independent variable, this relationship is described as the regression of y on x. The relationship can be represented by a simple equation called the regression equation. The regression equation representing how much y changes with any given change of x can be used to construct a regression line on a scatter diagram, and in the simplest case this is assumed to be a straight line.
